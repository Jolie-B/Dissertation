Broken Car
My car is broken. I decided to go to the garage to get it checked.
I arrived at the garage and they drove my car up onto the ramp.
They lifted the car up and took a look.
When they’d finished looking, they came back to me and told me that the engine was broken and it couldn't be fixed.
The car was old, it had a 2008 number plate.
So it was decision time. I needed a new car but which car to choose?
I wanted a small car so it's easier to park when I arrive at work because big cars are difficult for me to park.
I wanted a not too expensive car and a car that's cheap to run. 
I decided on a small red Fiat 500, it looked nice.
I don't have the money to pay for it right now but I will pay £210 every month for four years.
Now I am the proud owner of a new car.
