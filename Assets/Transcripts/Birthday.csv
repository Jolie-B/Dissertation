Tom’s 18th Birthday 
We decided to go for dinner because it was Toms 18th birthday. 
There were two families together, about 14 of us in total.
I phoned the restaurant beforehand so I could go and put up balloons and banners before everyone arrived. 
There was lots of food and it was difficult to choose. 
First, I had tomato soup and a bread roll.
Second, I had chicken with mushroom sauce and new potatoes and green vegetables
Third, for dessert, I had sticky toffee pudding.
It was all delicious. 
It was a brilliant night. 
The waiter brought us a birthday cake and Tom blew out the candles. 
We gave a gift of a photo album with pictures of Tom growing up from a baby to 18 years old. 
We all had a great time.
